Book: The richest man in Babylon 
1. Start thy purse to fattening
    - One should always save at least 10% of one’s all earnings.

2. Control thy expenditures 
    - What each of us calls our “necessary expenses” will always grow to equal our incomes unless we protest to the contrary.
    - Confuse not necessary expenses with thy desires.
    - Men are burdened with more desires that thy can gratify.
    - Budget for what is a necessity and for desires that you want but it should not be taken from one-tenths.


3. Make thy gold multiply 
    - A man’s wealth is not in the coins he carries in his purse; it is the income he builders, the golden stream that continually floweth into his purse and keepth it always bulging.
    - That is what each one of thee desireth; an income that continueth to come whether you work or travel.
    - Put each coin to laboring that it may reproduce its kind even as flocks of field and help bring to thee income, a stream of wealth that shall flow constantly into thy purse.

4. Guard thy treasure from loss
    - Misfortune loves a shining mark. Gold in a man’s purge must be guarded with firmness.
    - Guard thy treasures from loss by investing only where thy principal is safe, where it may be reclaimed if desirable, and where thou will not fail to collect a fair rental. Consult with a wise man. 
    - Secure the advice of those experienced in the profitable handling of gold. Let their wisdom protect thy treasure from unsafe investments.


5. Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment 
    - If a man settleth aside nine parts of his earnings upon which to live and enjoy life, and if any part of this nine parts he can put into a profitable investment without detriment to his well-being, then so much faster will his treasures grow.
    - No man’s family can fully enjoy life unless they do have a plot of ground wherein children can play in the clean earth and where the wife may raise not only blossoms but good rich herbs to feed her family.
    - Own thy home


6. Insure a future income
    - For a lean purse to a man no longer able to earn or to a family without its head is a sore tragedy.
    - Provide in advance for the needs of the growing age and the protection of thy family.

7. Increase the ability to earn
    - I observed that other works did more than I and were paid more. 
    - Therefore, did I determine that I would be exceeded by none. More concentration upon my task, more persistence in my effort, and, behold, few men could do more in a day than I could.

Things as the following a man must do if he respect himself:
- He must pay his debts with all the promptness with his power, not purchasing that for which he is unable to pay.
- He must take care of his family that they may think and speak well of him.
- He must make a will of record that, in case the gods call him, proper and honorable division of his property be accomplished
- He must have compassion upon those who are injured and smitten by misfortune and aid them within reasonable limits.
- He must do deeds of thoughtfulness to those dear to him.
Cultivate thy own powers, to study and come wiser, to become more skillful, to so act as to respect thyself

——
Humans in the throes of great emotions are not safe risks for the gold lender.
If you desire to help thy friend, do so in a way that will not bring thy burdens upon thyself.
